# Hexagon

Unity quality-of-life library.

The project is constantly evolving. No backwards compatibility is guaranteed. It is mainly developed for my own projects and they are always first to test new features.

## Documentation

[Documentation](https://ananasikdev.github.io/Hexagon/html/index.html) is auto-generated using Doxygen. Some pieces are also extended with manual pages.

## Features

(From most important to least)

- Pool
- State machine
- Math
- Vector operations, swizzling
- Random
- Easing *(in progress)*
- Assets
- String variable formatting
- Color operations
- Collections
- Audio
- Transform

And a few other minor features.

Some of the functions are tested with Unity unit tests.
